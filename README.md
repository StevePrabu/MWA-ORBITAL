# MWA-ORBITAL
The MWA lOw eaRth orBIT spAce surveiLlance (ORBITAL) pipeline

The git repo is intended to contain the final working version of the MWA non-coherent SSA pipeline.


It is an improved, commented, "well maintained", final? version of the MWA-SDA pipeline and is derived from my old MWA SDA pipelines made for the blind survey study, space fest 2020, orbit determination study and the shift-stack search. (If you want to look at the previous versions of this pipeline, check out https://github.com/StevePrabu/Space-Fest, https://github.com/StevePrabu/MWA-calibration, https://github.com/StevePrabu/DUG-MWA-SSA-Pipeline, https://github.com/StevePrabu/MWASSA-Pipeline)

Also uses nextflow??
